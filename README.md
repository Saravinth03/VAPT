# VAPT Project using Kali Linux  

## 📌 Overview:
This project contains a **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)** command list for conducting security testing on a web application using **Kali Linux**. The `commands.txt` file includes step-by-step terminal commands to perform vulnerability scanning and exploitation.<br />

## 📂 Files Included: 
- **commands.txt** → A text file containing all necessary Kali Linux commands for VAPT.<br />
- **README.md** → Documentation on how to use the commands.<br />

## 🔧 Tools Used:
The following tools are used in the **VAPT process**:<br />
- **Nmap** → Network scanning<br />
- **Nikto** → Web server vulnerability scanning<br />
- **OWASP ZAP** → Web application security testing<br /> 
- **SQLmap** → SQL injection testing<br />
- **Metasploit Framework** → Exploitation<br />
- **Burp Suite** → Web penetration testing<br />
- **Hydra** → Password brute force attack<br />

## 🚀 How to Use:
### **Step 1: Transfer the File to Kali Linux**  
1. **Download the project** from GitHub.  
   ```bash<br />
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/VAPT-Project.git
   cd VAPT-Project
If you downloaded manually, move commands.txt to your Kali Linux system.<br />

### **Step 2: Execute Commands in Kali Linux**
1. Open **Kali Linux** Terminal.<br />
2. Use the **cat** command to view the commands:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   cat commands.txt
3. **Manually** execute each command step-by-step as per the testing requirements.<br />

## 📜 VAPT Steps (Covered in commands.txt):
✅ 1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)<br />
Scanning open ports and services using Nmap.<br />

✅ 2. Web Server and Application Scanning<br />
Running Nikto for web server vulnerabilities.<br />
Scanning web applications using OWASP ZAP.<br />

✅ 3. Exploitation and Penetration Testing<br />
Performing SQL Injection using SQLmap.<br />
Exploiting vulnerabilities with Metasploit.<br />
Brute-forcing login credentials using Hydra.<br />

✅ 4. Reporting and Mitigation<br />
Documenting vulnerabilities and security fixes.<br />
